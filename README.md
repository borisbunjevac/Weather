# Weather
Pages in HTML calling API's in JavaScript.
Description:
Build a simple HTML/JS app which, when you open the site, asks for a permission to read your current location, and then uses the http://openweathermap.org/current public API to fetch the weather for that location and displays it.
If the user denies to share the location, show a little input form for entering postcode or country, and display the weather based on that location.
